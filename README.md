Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a 23-year-old who's utterly fascinated by coding. The countless nights I've spent programming can vouch for that. 

## Technologies & Tools
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, Java, Bash, Powershell and dabbling with VBA and other sh*t.
- **Interests**: Writing Code in gerneral, Offensive cybersecurity, and more.
- **Projects**: While I've dabbled in numerous projects, some of the notable ones include "EzPizMenu" and "instacrab" which you can find in my repos.
- **Ookami**: My messenger chatbot project that has been a game-changer for me. With around 13,000 users, it was my rocket launch into the IT world.
