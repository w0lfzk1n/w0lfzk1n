*I'll bite everyone who starts calling me a furry! I AM NOT, I just love wolves :D*

Hey there! 👋 I'm a 23-year-old who's utterly fascinated by coding. The countless nights I've spent programming can vouch for that. 

## Technologies & Tools 🔧
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, Java, Bash, Powershell and dabbling with VBA and other sh*t.
- **Interests**: Writing Code in general, 🛡️ Offensive cybersecurity 🛡️, and more.
- **Projects**: I got my fingers in a lot projects, just check my Repo.
- **Ookami**: My messenger chatbot project that has been a game-changer for me. With around 13,000 users, it was my rocket launch into the IT world.
- **AI**: No, I'm not talking about ChatGPT. I'm talking about transforming your dusty home computer into a nuclear reactor just to get a low-quality picture or a text filled with repetitive sentences.
- **Raspberry Pi**:
    - **MamaPi:** My go-to Raspberry Pi that acts as a NAS and more for me.
    - **PapaPi:** My experimental Raspberry Pi. Sometimes it's running Kali Linux to test MamaPi's security *(you know, the weird things adults do when they feel fancy)*, and other times it's my guinea pig for hardware tests using my module kit.

# Goals 🚀
- **Make my coding DRY**: Yeah, make it dry. Don't Repeat Yourself...
- **Expand my Skills**: I know a lot, but not enough!
- **Rock my work**: Trying to smoothly pass my stuff in school.
- **Get more sleep**: It’s not a bug – it’s an undocumented feature. <-< *Who needs sleep nowadays when you have energy drinks and drugs?*
- **Get active in CyberSec**: Even though I already dabble in it, I aim to dive deeper and get real fancy with cybersecurity.
